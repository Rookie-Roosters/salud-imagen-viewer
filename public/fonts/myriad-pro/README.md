# Myriad Pro Font

To use Myriad Pro in this application, you need to place the following font files in this directory:

- `MyriadPro-Regular.otf`
- `MyriadPro-Bold.otf`
- `MyriadPro-It.otf`
- `MyriadPro-BoldIt.otf`

## Important Notes

1. Myriad Pro is an Adobe font and requires a license to use legally.
2. You can purchase the font from Adobe or use it through Adobe Fonts (formerly Typekit) if you have an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.
3. If you have the font files in a different format, you may need to convert them to OTF format or update the CSS file to match your available font formats.

Once you've placed the font files in this directory, the application will automatically use Myriad Pro as the primary font.
